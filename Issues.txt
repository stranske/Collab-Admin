# Issues.txt - Agent Issue Queue
# ===============================
# Format: Numbered issues with structured sections
# 
# Each issue should have:
# - Numbered title (e.g., "1) Issue title")
# - Labels: line with comma-separated labels
# - Why: Explanation of the need
# - Scope: What's included/excluded
# - Tasks: Checkboxes for work items
# - Acceptance criteria: Verification checkboxes
# - Implementation notes: Technical details
#
# Issues with "agent:codex" label will be picked up by agent automation.
# 
# Example format below:

1) Set up initial project structure and tests
Labels: agent:codex, enhancement, setup

Why
The project needs a solid foundation with proper testing, linting, and CI integration.
This establishes the patterns that all future development will follow.

Scope
- Create minimal Python package structure
- Set up pytest with coverage reporting
- Configure ruff for linting
- Configure mypy for type checking
- Ensure all CI checks pass

Non-Goals
- Complex business logic (future issues)
- Documentation site (separate issue)

Tasks
- [ ] Create src/my_project/__init__.py with version
- [ ] Create src/my_project/main.py with sample function
- [ ] Create tests/test_main.py with basic tests
- [ ] Configure pyproject.toml with all tools
- [ ] Verify ruff check passes
- [ ] Verify mypy check passes
- [ ] Verify pytest passes with >80% coverage

Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Package can be installed with pip install -e .
- [ ] Running pytest shows all tests passing
- [ ] Running ruff check shows no issues
- [ ] Running mypy shows no errors
- [ ] Coverage report shows >80% coverage

Implementation notes
- Use modern pyproject.toml format (no setup.py)
- Target Python 3.11+ 
- Use src layout for package
- Follow strict mypy configuration

2) Add auto-revision-issues workflow for review follow-ups
Labels: needs-human, workflow

Why
Creating the workflow requires editing protected files under .github/workflows.

Scope
- Add the workflow that runs on review record changes to create follow-up issues

Non-Goals
- Adjusting the create_revision_issues script logic

Tasks
- [ ] Copy templates/auto-revision-issues.yml to .github/workflows/auto-revision-issues.yml
- [ ] Verify the workflow triggers on review file changes

Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Workflow runs on review changes and creates issues

Implementation notes
- Requires agent-high-privilege due to workflow file edits.
- Use templates/auto-revision-issues.yml as the source.
