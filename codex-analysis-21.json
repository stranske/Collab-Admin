The task 'Create workstream progress overview showing completion by workstream' is in progress as it was mentioned as a next step but no evidence of completion was provided. The task 'Add requirements.txt or update pyproject.toml with streamlit dependencies' is also in progress since there was no evidence of updates to dependencies in the session output. The remaining tasks are blocked due to the absence of necessary files or directories, as indicated by failed commands related to the 'reviews' directory and the lack of any progress on those tasks.", "data_source": "jsonl", "input_length": 22542, "analysis_text_length": 4095, "effort_score": 53, "data_quality": "high", "session": {"event_count": 62, "message_count": 1, "command_count": 18, "file_change_count": 2, "todo_count": 0}}
