# AI Policy (project-specific)

## Accountability
You are accountable for what you submit. AI assistance is never an excuse.

## Trend_Model_Project understanding work
For Trend_Model_Project understanding/evaluation deliverables, **no AI assistance** is permitted.
Write-ups must be grounded in direct reading/tracing and include file/function references.

## Other workstreams
AI-assisted coding is allowed, but PRs must include clean explanations, tests where appropriate, and CI must pass.
