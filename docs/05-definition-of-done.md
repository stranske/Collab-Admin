# Definition of Done

Work is “done” when:

1. The intended artifact exists in-repo (or is linked from a PR).
2. The submission packet is complete.
3. CI is green (or the deviation is explicitly approved and documented).
4. The work is reviewed using the appropriate rubric pack.
5. Required revisions (if any) are addressed.

For Trend understanding work, “done” additionally requires:

- direct code references (paths + line ranges)
- a walkthrough-ready narrative (you can be interrupted mid-sentence and still defend the claim)
