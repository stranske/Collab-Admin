# Review Workflow

Reviews are intentionally descriptor-first: the goal is consistent, defensible feedback, not “points.”

## Inputs

- The PR (code/docs)
- The submission packet (`templates/submission_packet.md`)
- Any linked artifacts (memos, diagrams, logs)

## Outputs

- A review record in `reviews/YYYY-MM/...yaml` (rating per rubric dimension + highlighted descriptors + feedback)
- Optional follow-up issues for required revisions

## Review cadence

- Workstream deliverables: reviewed as they land (avoid “end of week dump”)
- Weekly checkpoint: short status note + time summary
