# Month-End Settlement

The intent is boring clarity.

## Inputs

- time logs (`logs/time/`)
- deliverables shipped (PR links)
- review outcomes (`reviews/`)
- approved expenses (`logs/expenses/`)

## Output

- a month-end memo in `logs/month_end/YYYY-MM.md`.

The first version can be manual text assembly. Automation comes after you trust the schema.
