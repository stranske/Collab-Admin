# Marketplace Implementation Plan Protocol

Goal: produce a step-by-step plan for packaging two workflows for broader distribution.

Constraints:
- at least two candidate platforms (current approach + Zapier or n8n)
- explicit evaluation rubric (time, reliability, security, maintainability, cost)
- two-week execution schedule with exit criteria

Execution is optional unless Tim approves.
