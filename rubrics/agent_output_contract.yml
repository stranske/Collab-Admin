rubric_id: agent_output_contract
title: Agent output contract
key_question: "Does the agent output contract define stable, machine-readable results, artifacts, and safety expectations that keep keepalive/verifier agent-agnostic?"
levels: [Poor, Mediocre, High, Excellent]
dimensions:
  - id: machine_readable_result
    name: Machine-readable result object
    descriptors:
      Poor: "No structured result object or fields are inconsistent across runs."
      Mediocre: "Partial structure, but fields are missing or semantics vary by agent."
      High: "Consistent result object with clear pass/fail and summary fields."
      Excellent: "Fully specified schema with validation rules and examples across agents."
  - id: artifact_naming
    name: Stable artifact and filename contract
    descriptors:
      Poor: "Artifact filenames vary or are undocumented; outputs are hard to locate."
      Mediocre: "Some naming guidance but missing required files or stability guarantees."
      High: "Required artifacts and filenames are stable and documented."
      Excellent: "Artifact contract includes versioning, locations, and backward compatibility notes."
  - id: integration_compatibility
    name: Compatibility with keepalive and verifier
    descriptors:
      Poor: "Requires per-agent special casing or manual interpretation."
      Mediocre: "Mostly compatible but needs ad hoc handling for edge cases."
      High: "Compatible with existing workflows without special cases."
      Excellent: "Proves compatibility via tests or fixtures in integration coverage."
  - id: safety_logging
    name: Safety and logging constraints
    descriptors:
      Poor: "No mention of secrets or logging constraints; risk of leaking sensitive data."
      Mediocre: "Mentions constraints but lacks enforceable requirements."
      High: "Explicit rules for no secrets in logs and redaction expectations."
      Excellent: "Clear safety requirements plus enforcement/validation steps."
  - id: documentation_readiness
    name: Documentation and onboarding readiness
    descriptors:
      Poor: "Contract is undocumented or missing onboarding guidance."
      Mediocre: "Basic documentation but unclear for new agent integrators."
      High: "Docs enable a new agent to implement the contract with minimal help."
      Excellent: "Docs-first walkthrough with checklists and troubleshooting notes."
