levels: [Poor, Mediocre, High, Excellent]
dimensions:
  - id: protocol_compliance
    name: Protocol compliance
    descriptors:
      Poor: "No statement of no-AI compliance or indicates AI assistance was used."
      Mediocre: "Implied compliance but no explicit attestation."
      High: "Explicitly states no AI assistance and follows the protocol."
      Excellent: "Explicit no-AI attestation plus brief process notes showing compliance."
  - id: evidence_references
    name: Evidence references coverage
    descriptors:
      Poor: "Missing References section or references are not in the required format."
      Mediocre: "References exist but miss required categories or use inconsistent anchors."
      High: "References follow the required format and cover key code anchors."
      Excellent: "References follow the required format with why-it-matters notes and strong coverage."
  - id: module_scope
    name: Module purpose and boundaries
    descriptors:
      Poor: "Module purpose or boundaries are missing or incorrect."
      Mediocre: "Basic purpose described but boundaries or ownership are vague."
      High: "Clear purpose with defined boundaries and dependencies."
      Excellent: "Precise purpose and boundaries with explicit ownership and interfaces."
  - id: call_paths
    name: Core call paths
    descriptors:
      Poor: "No call path tracing or only a high-level narrative."
      Mediocre: "One call path traced but incomplete or loosely connected to code."
      High: "Two or more call paths traced with code anchors."
      Excellent: "Multiple call paths traced with precise anchors and flow rationale."
  - id: edge_handling
    name: Error and edge path coverage
    descriptors:
      Poor: "No discussion of error or edge cases."
      Mediocre: "Mentions errors but lacks specific code paths or inputs."
      High: "Covers multiple error/edge paths with code references."
      Excellent: "Covers critical error/edge paths with triggering inputs and outcomes."
  - id: data_handling
    name: Data boundaries and parsing
    descriptors:
      Poor: "Ignores inputs, config, or data parsing."
      Mediocre: "Mentions data handling but omits key boundary conditions."
      High: "Describes core inputs/config parsing with evidence."
      Excellent: "Maps data boundaries and parsing behavior with risks and validation notes."
