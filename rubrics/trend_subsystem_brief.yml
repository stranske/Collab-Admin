title: Trend model subsystem brief
key_question: "Does the subsystem brief demonstrate evidence-backed understanding of the Trend model code paths, inputs, and risks?"
levels: [Poor, Mediocre, High, Excellent]
dimensions:
  - id: protocol_compliance
    name: Protocol compliance
    descriptors:
      Poor: "No statement of no-AI compliance or indicates AI assistance was used."
      Mediocre: "Implied compliance but no explicit attestation or process detail."
      High: "Explicitly states no AI assistance and follows the protocol."
      Excellent: "Explicit no-AI attestation plus brief process notes showing compliance."
  - id: evidence_references
    name: Evidence references coverage
    descriptors:
      Poor: "Missing References section or references are not in the required format."
      Mediocre: "References exist but miss required categories or use inconsistent anchors."
      High: "References follow the required format and cover most required categories."
      Excellent: "References follow the required format and meet/exceed minimum counts with why-it-matters notes."
  - id: entrypoints
    name: Entrypoints and boundaries
    descriptors:
      Poor: "Entrypoints are missing or incorrect; boundaries are vague."
      Mediocre: "Identifies at least one entrypoint but misses key boundaries or scope."
      High: "Identifies multiple entrypoints and main boundaries with minor gaps."
      Excellent: "Identifies all primary entrypoints and clearly defines boundaries and ownership."
  - id: call_paths
    name: Core call path traces
    descriptors:
      Poor: "No clear call path tracing; only high-level narrative."
      Mediocre: "One call path traced but incomplete or loosely connected to code."
      High: "Two or more call paths traced with adequate code anchors."
      Excellent: "Multiple call paths traced with precise anchors and rationale for flow."
  - id: edge_handling
    name: Error and edge path coverage
    descriptors:
      Poor: "No discussion of error or edge cases."
      Mediocre: "Mentions errors but lacks specific code paths or inputs."
      High: "Covers multiple error/edge paths with code references."
      Excellent: "Covers critical error/edge paths with triggering inputs and outcomes."
  - id: data_handling
    name: Data boundaries, configuration, parsing
    descriptors:
      Poor: "Ignores inputs, config, or data parsing."
      Mediocre: "Mentions data handling but omits key boundary conditions."
      High: "Describes core inputs/config parsing with evidence."
      Excellent: "Maps data boundaries and parsing behavior with risks and validation notes."
  - id: change_hotspots
    name: Change hotspots and risks
    descriptors:
      Poor: "No identification of hotspots or risk areas."
      Mediocre: "Lists hotspots without evidence or prioritization."
      High: "Identifies likely hotspots with references and rationale."
      Excellent: "Prioritized hotspots with evidence, impact, and suggested first fixes."
